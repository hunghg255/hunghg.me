  about: `
Hi, my name is Hung, i'm 28 years old. I got a bachelor of Electronics Telecommunication Engineering at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology (2015 - 2020). Besides, i am really passionate about Javascript and Web Development.

I started learning web programming in 2018. Before that, I had a background in C / C ++ programming so getting access to javascript is not difficult. I have been in love with javascript since I did not know it, I like it. I searched many different sources to learn about this language for example: Developer mozilla, You Don't Know JS.... I also took some online courses like React The Complete Guide in Redux...

In December 2019, when school was almost done, I decided to do an internship at a company to experience what a real environment is like. I learned a lot from my boss and colleagues while working.

I want to be a good person in the field that I have chosen so I tried a lot, worked hard.
