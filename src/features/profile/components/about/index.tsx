            Hi, my name is <span className={styles.hightLight}>Hung</span>,

            bachelor of Electronics Telecommunication Engineering at Ha Noi
            University of Science and Technology (2015 - 2020). Besides, i am
            really passionate about{" "}

          <p>
            I started learning web programming in 2018. Before that, I had a
            background in C / C ++ programming so getting access to javascript
            is not difficult. I have been in love with javascript since I did
            not know it, I like it. I searched many different sources to learn
            about this language for example:{" "}
            <span>
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Developer mozilla</a>
            </span>
            ,{" "}
            <span>
              <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">
                You Don&apos;t Know JS
              </a>
            </span>
            .... I also took some online courses like{" "}
            <span>
              <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">
                React The Complete Guide in Redux
              </a>
            </span>
            ...
          </p>

          <p>
            In December 2019, when school was almost done, I decided to do an
            internship at a company to experience what a real environment is
            like. I learned a lot from my boss and colleagues while working.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to be a good person in the field that I have chosen so I
            tried a lot, worked hard.
